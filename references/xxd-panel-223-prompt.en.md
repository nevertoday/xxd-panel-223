# Panel 223 runtime adapter

The canonical source brief is `references/original-prompt/zh-CN.md`. This adapter records delivery variables only and never replaces the original aesthetic instructions.

- Modes: `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`, `wallpaper-pack`
- Comparison modes use a strict 50:50 split: reality above for top-bottom and reality left for left-right.
- Text: `prompt`, `exact`, or `none`; resolve the target locale explicitly.
- Sizes: `auto`, `source`, common ratios, custom ratios, or exact pixels.
- Inputs: one image or an isolated directory batch.

Append this adapter after the complete verbatim Chinese source brief. For `left-right`, replace only its upper/lower delivery coordinates with left/right, preserving the same aesthetic and a strict 50:50 division; do not let the original portrait instruction override an explicitly requested landscape layout. For `design-only` or `wallpaper-pack`, use the full canvas for the designed region and keep the source photograph invisible. Text modes and the resolved locale override only language and exact wording, never the original image–text composition principles. No extra outer canvas band or second stylisation pass. Preserve source-required frames, grids, containers and sidebars within the designed region.
